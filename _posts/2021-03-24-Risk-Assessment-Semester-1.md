> :warning: Dealing with security threats is of critical importance in our development of database and website applications. We adopt a framework from the NIST guide to provide strategies for evaluating and prioritizing security risks.

{% include toc %}

## Background

Two parallel components are at the center of our project: database design and website integration. Both of them are comprised of services and segments that are common targets in network security. For example, the database, wherever it’s hosted, is susceptible to malware attacks and illegal hacking. Meanwhile, the website can easily fall victim to threats such as denial of service (DoS) attacks.

## Risks Management

In accordance with the [Risk Management Guide for Information Technology Systems(NIST guide) for the National Institution of Standards and Technology](https://ucop.edu/information-technology-services/initiatives/resources-and-tools/sp800-30.pdf), we conduct five vital steps to assess the risks in our project:

- Develop risk measurement criteria
- Inventory IT assets
- Identify threats
- Document existing controls
- Identify improvements

## Risk Rating

![Risk Rating](https://cdn-std.droplr.net/files/acc_498334/5F0zlJ)
The above ratings are based on the likelihood of an event occurring (from most unlikely to most likely) and the severity of the issues that might arise if the event does occur (from trivial issues to major issues).

## Project Management Risks

### Approaches to mitigate risks:

- Poor productivity (Possible to improbable): assign tasks to team members on each meeting and keep work records
- Lack of ownership (Improbable to impossible): signed the IP contract
- Team member turnover: keep a healthy vibe in communication
- Low stakeholder engagement (Probable to improbable): active communication, set agendas before meetings so everyone can be more prepared, lucky to have nice stakeholders
- Inadequate risk assessment (Probable to improbable): research and open for advice
- The ANU tech support can’t be reached: drop-in, via email, via clients, in progress
- Inaccurate estimation of the timeframe (Probable to Possible): from communication to get to know the details of the project more
- The product doesn’t meet stakeholders' expectations (Probable to Possible): agile methodology, integrating the prototype, and discuss with the clients many times.
- Poor documentation (Probable to Possible): team charter, work records, product requirements, statement of work, risk assessment, retrospectives…
- Sudden growth in requirements (Intolerable and Probable to Tolerable and Possible): agile methodology, integrating the prototype, and discuss with the clients many times.
