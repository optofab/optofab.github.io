[1] Initial challenge description:

- Our client needs a convenient way to get orders online;
- Our client needs to efficiently process and archive orders with the help of a local order management system.

[2] [_Personal_] Who is the client? What motivates the client?

- Out client:

  | Name     | **ANFF OptoFab ACT**                                                                                                                                                                                         |
  | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
  | Website  | http://optofab-act.org.au                                                                                                                                                                                    |
  | Contacts | Johannes Eichholz: <johannes.eichholz@anu.edu.au><br> Deon Hickey: <Deon.Hickey@anu.edu.au><br> Steve Madden: <stephen.madden@anu.edu.au><br>Sukanta Debbarma : <debbarma.sukanta@anu.edu.au> |

- Our client is motivated in freeing themselves from the red tapes dealing with emails, paparwork, and endless phone calls when they process an order from the customer.

<hr class="hr-dotted">

[3] [_Organisational_] What is the current operation of the business like?

- Currently, if the customer wants a customised optic lens, he needs to look for infomation on the [official website](https://optofab-act.org.au/), and contact the director Steve via email or phone call. The details and parameters are negotiated in the communications and finalised in an attachment document.
- Once the details are settled, the client prepare the processing of optics accordingly. The customer might not get timely update until it is done.
- Afterwards, the orders are archived manually, either by typing it in a documents or printing it out. There is no easy way to organise the orders for later analysis.

<hr class="hr-dotted">

[4] What is currently working? What can be improved?

- [_Working_] The whole process of taking orders then manufacturing optical components accordingly, and archiving files as a wrap-up is working well, with sufficient overhead in time.
- [_To be improved_] The optimisation of the process with the assistance of online platform for placing orders and a order management system for effient archiving and tracking each order.

<hr class="hr-dotted">

[5] [_Environmental_] What environment do they operate in?

- Our client is specialised in full customised optics, coatings, chips for researchers and industrial users. There are few competitors with the same level of expertise across Australia.

<hr class="hr-dotted">

[6] [_Customers/Users_] What do they currently see as their users/customer segment?

- The client's customers come mainly from the academia, e.g., reserchers in optics from physics department of a university. Some start-ups may also be the potential customers if they want to customise optic parts and test some ideas before mass production. The price is affordable and the quality is incomparable across Australia.

<hr class="hr-dotted">

[7] [_Value Proposition_] What is/do they think is their current value proposition?

- First of all, their product and services are of high quality with palatable prices.
- [_Gains_] If more potential customers get to know and make deals with them, the client's business may be booming.
- [_Pains_] However, the procedures in reality are dragging the efficiency down, with huge time devoted in minor details and later files archiving.

<hr class="hr-dotted">

[8] What is the 'Gap'/'Perceived Gap'?

- The gap lies between the traditional way of doing businesses with phone calls, meetings, and emails, and the so called _Internet thinking_ model of making deals and scale up businesses. Once the website is set up with user-friendly interfaces, both the customers and the client can focus more on the product and services. On the other hand, the local database is also a booster for the clients' future business optimization.
