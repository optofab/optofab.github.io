## Audit Q&A

1. Mr Grek (tutor): the testing cycle in the roadmap is only 1 week, is it enough to integrate the changes and fix the issues?

2. Shadow team: why not store the data on the cloud? How will the database work?

3. Dr Priscilla (examiner):

   - How does it come about that the team changes the approach to developing the website to `React.js`?
   - Why is only one team member presenting the audit?
   - What's the ratinale in merging the reflection and decision making sections in the project on the landing page?
