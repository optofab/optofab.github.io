### Tag Reports

Our client, shadow team and tutor have completed the tag reports and provided constructive feedback according to the [evaluation process](https://cs.anu.edu.au/TechLauncher/current_students/evaluation/tag_reports/).

## Rubrics

Refer to: <https://cs.anu.edu.au/TechLauncher/current_students/evaluation/project_audits/ >

## Feedback

The feedback is mainly based on the tag reports from the TechLauncher Feedback Portal.

### Project Output

**Good**

The team's made progress with the deliverables, and the client is quite happy about the outcomes except for a few technical challenges right at the end. 

**Bad**

[I1 from tutor] "...the order management appears to lagging behind"
[I2 from shadow] Some technical bugs on the website portal

**How to improve"
[Suggestion1 (S1 for short) from tutor] "In reality both systems perform similar functions - and common approaches could be used for both." :question: Need further elaboration
[S2] Need to add these bugs to the bug report in our handover document, and try to fix them whenever possible. 

### Decision Making

**Good**

Our client reckons that the decision making process is robust and well motivated. 

**Bad**

[I3 from tutor] "The decision log contains a mix of design and project management decisions."
[I4 from shadow] "There are also some very important technical decisions made during the meetings missing from the decision logs e.g. adjusting the upload buttons due to martin’s refusal to take responsibility."

**How to improve**

[S3] Maybe by cataloguing different decisions in dedicated sections, the whole structure of the decision making log can be clearer. :question: Need further suggestions
[S4] Nice spot! We'll add it into our decision making log.

### Teamwork

**Good**

Overall, the team's been operating effectively to deliver values to the client. 

**Bad**
[I5 from tutor] "The team has made good progress and seems to have worked well, although their customer has been challenging with respect to their expectations about tools and deployment architectures. "
[I6 from shadow] "the team may want to look into accountability issues among the members. It is difficult to imagine the “better days” soundtrack took 2 hours to find or narrating the video taking 3 hours (repeating 60 times). But if the team really did do so, I apologize for my suspicion."

**How to improve**
[S5] About the security challenges we're facing right now, the team's made some suggestions for both our client and the following team. :question: Need further clarification. We would love to learn from different tools and deployment procedures.
[S6] :question: Maybe we'll discuss this in the tutorial

### Communication

**Good**

Overall, the communication between the team and the client is open and frequent. 

**Bad**
[I7 from our team members] "The team could have made the client understand the necessity of cloud services or two servers earlier."
[I8 form our team members] "The conversation with RSPhy has not led to the best result but it was anticipated due to the fact that the product is not the final release and can be tested and improved regarding cyber security next semester."

**How to improve**
[S7] :question: Discuss and seek advice in the tutorial 
[S8 from tutor] "In the final weeks you should focus on keeping the customer communication open and frequent to ensure you complete all their handover requirements." 

### Reflection

**Good**

It's great that we learn from our lessons and actively tackle the challenges.

**Bad**
[I9 from shadow] "The output of reflections should be maintained"

**How to improve**
[S9 from tutor] '''There are several valuable insights in your reflection log, and if I was to to summarize they would be “it’s always harder than it looks, it always takes longer that I thought”. The team members should keep these lessons in mind for future work, but also in completing the work in the last few weeks.'''
