## Project Overview

| Local Order Management System                                                   | [Customer Portal Web Application](http://tl20212.cecs.anu.edu.au/home.html)                    |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Import orders submitted on the ANFF OptoFab website       | Allow customers to place orders in an OptoFab-staff-friendly way  |
| Store and display client order specifications, links of metrology and operational information    | Allow customers to provide feedback and request for modification      |
| Search and sort the orders and parts by certain attributes                  | Show order status by order number on the web page                    |
| Export a list of statuses for each order. | After order submitting, generate a readable email for both the customer and OptoFab staff, attach a JSON file for later importing |

- Must be easily maintained and modified by untrained non-IT staff
- Must be intuitive for both clients and users
- Must be flexible enough to be modified and reused for future capabilities
- Must comply with ANU IT security requirements
- CSIT and the IT department of RSPhys must be consulted on design and implementation

## Stakeholder analysis

<img style="display:block;margin:auto;width:70%" src="https://cdn-std.droplr.net/files/acc_498334/n2d8um" alt="stakeholder analysis">

- High power, interested people: must fully engage and make the greatest efforts to satisfy.
- High power, less interested people: put enough work in to keep them satisfied, but not so much that they become bored with the update.
- Low power, interested people: keep them adequately informed, communicate to ensure that no major issues are arising. Can often be very helpful with the detail of our project.
- Low power, less interested people: monitor them but do not bore them with excessive communication
