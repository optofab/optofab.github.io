## Stakeholder analysis

<img style="display:block;margin:auto;width:70%" src="https://cdn-std.droplr.net/files/acc_498334/n2d8um" alt="stakeholder analysis">

- High power, interested people: must fully engage and make the greatest efforts to satisfy.
- High power, less interested people: put enough work in to keep them satisfied, but not so much that they become bored with the update.
- Low power, interested people: keep them adequately informed, communicate to ensure that no major issues are arising. Can often be very helpful with the detail of our project.
- Low power, less interested people: monitor them but do not bore them with excessive communication
