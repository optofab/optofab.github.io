| Attendance | Greg Bek, Wo Tian, Tian Wu, Hengrui Xu, Ruiqiao Jiang, Guoyu Wang, Yaoyi Xu, Ruoqian Wu |

**AGENDA**

The content of agenda is from the email sent to our tutor and shadow team:

> Our team would like to focus on the feedback from the audit report of week 3 for Wednesday tutorial.<br>
> On Monday, we had a group meeting discussing and reflecting on the critiques and suggestions from tutor, client and shadow team. We appreciate the honest feedback, and we would like to improve our work in the future.  However, we do need clarifications on some of the comments.<br>
> Our team has marked the points for tomorrow’s tutorial with question mark ❓ in <https://optofab.github.io/retrospectives/2021-08-16-Retrospective-Audit-1-Semester2/> , please check it out.

**DISCUSSIONS & ACTIONS**

The list number of the following discussion points correspond to the :question: marks on the [retrospective page](https://optofab.github.io/retrospectives/2021-08-16-Retrospective-Audit-1-Semester2/).

1. "Table of contents in dropdown menu conflicts with navbar". <br>
   It's a misunderstanding of the landing page structure. All good. <br>

2. "SOW does not outline what deliverables you will make and how progress will be measured by your team and your customer." <br>
   All aspects mentioned in the SOW are team's deliverables. In the future, include more details in the statement of work to be more descriptive and clear. However, since this time the SOW has already been signed, there would be no need to modify it now. <br>

3. "It is concerning that you consider the risk of serious data mismatching as Possible 'Risk will likely occur'." <br>
   At the time of assessing the risks, our team could anticipate a possibility of data mismatch since the this was an issue for last semester. However, issues like data mismatch could lead to serious consequences, so the lesson is that for the risk register to be effective and practical, the team should come up with potential solutions to mitigate the risks in a concrete way. Ideally, the risk assessment should be practical and specific to the project the team is working on. <br>

4. "There have been a few instances where the team have had to refactor something multiple times because they started before finalising design/negotiation with clients on that aspect of the project." <br>
   The process is actually very agile though it doesn't follow the agile way to the word, because the team are working on one sprint per week and trying to deliver to the client constantly. <br>

5. "It may be too early to judge team collaboration until substantial work has been done but evidence of team work can be better shown with more detailed communications documentation and better formatted to do list. It appears difficult for an outsider to understand the to-do list as it is." <br>
   At the moment, the team cannot afford perfecting every document for stakeholders that are not our client. As long as the document such as the to-do list is sufficient for team members to understand and the team to make progress, it would suffice. <br>

6. "The team should make sure that the deputy spokesperson is in a position to backup the project manager, and that in turn one or two other team members shadows the deputy. " <br>
   The deputy spokesperson should be aware of the situation. For example, the deputy should join in the meeting every few weeks as a listening ear. On the other hand, actually every member is briefed every Monday and Friday night in the group meeting after the spokesperson holds a meetings with the client. <br>

7. "Though it is clear that the team has benefitted from having one person communicate with the client, the client mentioned a lag when contacting the necessary members of the team." + "It is suggested that the team assign a Front End leader and Back End leader to join the client meetings together with the project manager." <br>
   The suggestion has a good point, but current situation of project development makes it too late to adopt this suggestion, as the team has to allocate time in a more efficient way by assigning one spokesperson to communicate with the client and the rest of the team working on the implementation. <br>

8. "The team should have a reflection log, and individually every team member should have some reflections to capture as well." <br>
   The purpose of the reflection is for every member's voice to be heard and it also shows interactions and growth within the team. The personal reflection is optional and not necessarily kept weekly, but it would be good to show the evidence of team member's development along the journey. <br>

9. "It would be better if the team could add the rationale behind each risk or even add a reflection log to show evidence of reflection among the team. Similar to the decision log, what exactly happened that gave rise to each risk." <br>
   The team would add more pluses and minuses in the outcomes in the records. In this way, when reviewing in the future, one can easily grasp the big picture from these records. <br>

#### Week 5

| Date       | 25/08/2021                                                                              |

| Attendance | Greg Bek, Wo Tian, Tian Wu, Hengrui Xu, Ruiqiao Jiang, Guoyu Wang, Yaoyi Xu, Ruoqian Wu |

**AGENDA**

The content of agenda is from the email sent to our tutor and shadow team:

1. How to upgrade our website hosted at http://tl20212.cecs.anu.edu.au/ from `http` to `https`?
2. Based on the feedback and discussion, our team have adopted many suggestions and made changes in our landing page site (see updated status in https://optofab.github.io/retrospectives/2021-08-16-Retrospective-Audit-1-Semester2/ where ⛵️ means ongoing changes and ☑️ means changes adopted). Moreover, team members have added their personal reflection logs in https://optofab.github.io/logs/#reflection-log
3. We would like to do better for next audit, so is there a detailed rubric on the audit for both teams to check and improve?

**DISCUSSIONS & ACTIONS**

1. "It will be better if you can neet with our shadow team from time to time to discuss the project status".<br>
2. If we want to change from HTTP to HTTPS, we need to apply for a certificate for the website. We need to buy SSL certificate, and we need to modify and convert the server configuration of the current website. In addition, we need to change all hyperlinks using HTTP to HTTPS in the source code of our website.<br>
3. We can follow the requirement on the TechLauncher website. "https://cs.anu.edu.au/TechLauncher/current_students/evaluation/project_audits/". And also Greg sent us a detailed email about the expectations and suggestions for Audit 2.

#### Week 6 - Audit 2

| Attendance | Greg Bek, Wo Tian, Tian Wu, Hengrui Xu, Ruiqiao Jiang, Guoyu Wang, Yaoyi Xu, Ruoqian Wu |

**AGENDA**

The content of agenda is from the email sent to our tutor and shadow team:

For week6’s tutorial, our team would present our project audit by our fantastic team members: Ruiqiao Jiang, Guoyu Wang and Hengrui Xu. Also, Wo has invited our incredible clients to the audit!

The presentation would be divided into the following sections:

- First, a project introduction together with the project progress are presented for the audience, to give everyone a brief overview of our project.

- Then the presentation would focus on the four inseparable parts: documentation, decision making, teamwork, and communication. Through the bits of improvement over the last several weeks, we really want to show everyone what we’ve learnt as a team.

- Next, examples of team reflection are given as every team member strives to dig and delve consistently.

- What’s more, a future plan is also provided to show our commitment to this project.

- Last but not least, we would encourage everyone to get more involved by asking questions and putting forward suggestions!

**DISCUSSIONS & ACTIONS**

1. This part contains the Q&A following our audit presentation (after rephrasing and paraphrasing):

   1. Q: "How come there's a discrepancy of meeting hours in the personal work record and the meeting minutes"? - Shawn (shadow team)<br>
      A: "It's because sometimes two or more team members will extend the meeting to discuss about the project after the scheduled group meeting and other team members have left the zoom."

   2. Q: "For the front-end design, does the team stick to the `React` all the way?" - Qianwei (shadow team)<br>
      A: "`React` is a just a framework for front-end design, so it can be flexible."

   3. Q: "How do the website portal and the database managemeng system transfer data in between, since the team's using an offline database?" - Greg (tutor)<br>
      A: "It's a combination of auto import/export between the two systems for some data such as order records; other data need manual management by ANFF staff."

   4. "How does the renaming affect the teamwork and the client?" - Greg as (tutor)<br>
      A: "As the project moves on, the team has gained deeper understanding of the system design. So it's natural for both the team and the client to rename the sub-systems more accurately."

   5. "Do you have problematisation analysis?" - Priscilla (examiner)

2. This part is our client feedback

   1. "The decision of constructing a database for offline use is due to the considerations of our own stakeholders." - Deon (our client)

   2. "We're glad to see that the team is making efforts to provide detailed documentation in every artifact of the project, which would help a lot for the future work when this project is handed over to a new team next semester." - Deon (our client)

   3. "Considering the complexity of the project whose specifications also evolve now and then, the workload is massive. But the team help us understand the requirements along the way, and make practical decisions in the implementation of the product via frequent communications." - Steve (our client)

3. This part is suggestions from our tutor and examiner.

   1. "It's better to keep track of the logs and progresses using tools such as `Trello` and `Kanban`. In this way, every team member can see clearly the traces of efforts and it's beneficial to boost up the teamwork." - Greg (tutor)

   2. "In the future, one way to improve is to futher partition the logs and records into specific sections such as feedback." - Priscilla (examiner)

**AGENDA**

The content of agenda is from the email sent to our tutor and shadow team:

"
Our team would like to focus on the followings on this tutorial:

1. Feedback from the audit 2 report.
   a. On Monday, we had a group meeting discussing and reflecting on the critiques and suggestions from tutor, client and shadow team. We appreciate the honest feedback, and we would like to improve our work in the future.  However, we again need clarifications on some critiques.
   b. Our team has marked the points for this tutorial with question mark ❓ in https://optofab.github.io/retrospectives/2021-09-20-Retrospective-Audit-2-Semester2/, please check it out.
2. Preparation of the project video.
   a. Can we reuse some of the introductory clips from last semester?

"

**DISCUSSION & ACTIONS**

The :question: has been crossed out after the discussions with Greg.

1. About the time difference for completing tasks among the team members.
   Greg's suggestions: Sometime teams tend to spend too much time on TechLauncher projects. But be careful with the time allocations. Don't get too involved in one subject and forget to work on other subjects.

2. About communication via WeChat for teamwork.
   Greg's suggestions: As long as WeChat is what the team's comfortable with and helps improve the efficiency, it's OK to use.

3. About vagueness in the meeting logs.
   Greg's suggestions: Be good to the future self. It's not necessary to write down every detail, just enough that the future self or others can get the context and know what issues have been brought on the table. Also, list the pros and cons that are discussed, and record what's necessary for future reference.

4. About video preparation.
