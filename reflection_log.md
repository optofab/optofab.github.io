| 1         | 4        | Our peers and tutor this semester want to make sure that everyone's voice is heard by adding a reflection log and letting everyone participate in the tutorials and audits more. A good team should be adaptable. Therefore we will adjust our approach in the coming tutorials and audits.                                                      | Wo Tian    |
| 2         | 4        | We've got a relatively low score for Reflection on Audit 1. The course convenor, our tutor, and our shadow team all think that we should create a reflection log in Audit 1. <br/> We will actively listen to other people's advice and improve our documentation by adding a reflection log. (See the 8th decision in the decision-making log.) | Wo Tian    |
| 3         | 4        | Received feedback from Many Eyes Process regarding SOW. It would be better if we could write the SOW with more detailed deliverables in the future if we need to write SOW again.                                                                                                                                                                | Wo Tian    |
| 4         | 4        | It is indeed true that our team member should participate more and speak up our own thoughts during the audit and tutorials. It would be better if we could let different members to deliver presentations for audit and encourage everyone to speak.                                                                                            | Yaoyi Xu   |
| 5         | 4        | The lesson I learnt is that although I am a part of the team, and we received the feedback as the team, we should construct our individual reflection.                                                                                                                                                                                           | Ruoqian Wu |
| 6         | 4        | From the tutorial and the feedback from our shadow team, what I learnt is documentation is very important. Cause the other people outside our team know nothing about our project. They can only learn it from the documents we generated. Thus, we need to make our ducumentations very detailed.                                                                                                      | Ruiqiao Jiang |
| 7         | 4        | When I was refactoring the relational schema, I stuck by the messy structure. Mind maps really helped me to make a clear view of our database structure. After I have a clear view, I refactored our relational schema easily.                                                                                                      | Guoyu Wang |
| 8         | 4        | I have learnt that I should know more about others' work rather than only focusing on my own work.                                                                                                     | Hengrui Xu |
| 9         | 5        | The lesson I learnt is that since we are not very familiar with the database development, the time we spent on learning may be huge. And for example, we studied the C# for the management system, but I just found that the Django may be more suitable for our development.                                                                                                                                        |Ruiqiao Jiang |
| 10         | 5       | It is more efficient if backend can work in parallel with front-end instead of waiting for front-end finishing functionalities then start. Therefore, I decided to learn how to use Postman to test api functions.                                                                                                                                                                                           | Yaoyi Xu |
| 11         | 5       | The lesson I learnt is that there are many useful frameworks for development on Github to increase the work efficiency, and there is no need to build everything from scratch.                                                                                                                                                                                           | Ruoqian Wu |
| 12        | 5        | I have learnt that being adaptable is an impotant and valuable aspect to have for a team.                                                                                                                                                                                         | Wo Tian |
| 13        | 5        | During the tutorial, I found that if I am always prepared to speak out, I will focus more on our meeting and understand the meeting content better.                                                                                                                                                                                        | Guoyu Wang |
| 14        | 5        | Teamwork will be smoother if the details of the project are communicated to team members in advance.                                                                                                                                                                                        | Hengrui Xu |
