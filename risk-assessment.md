## Background

Unexpected events are inevitable. There could be many things, internally or externally, that affect the progress and result of the project. To mitigate the impacts of these risks, it is important to conduct a risk analysis upfront. This risk assessment will cover risks comming from the project management and technical aspects. Risk events are evaluated based on their likelihood and severity, and hence are classified as acceptable, tolerable, undesirable and intolerable.

## Risks Management

In accordance with the [Risk Management Guide for Information Technology Systems(NIST guide) for the National Institution of Standards and Technology](https://ucop.edu/information-technology-services/initiatives/resources-and-tools/sp800-30.pdf), we conduct five vital steps to assess the risks in our project:

- Develop risk measurement criteria
- Inventory IT assets
- Identify threats
- Document existing controls
- Identify improvements

<br>

## Risk Rating

![Risk Rating](https://cdn-std.droplr.net/files/acc_498334/5F0zlJ)
The above ratings are based on the likelihood of an event occurring (from most unlikely to most likely) and the severity of the issues that might arise if the event does occur (from trivial issues to major issues).

## Project Management Risks

### Attempted approaches to mitigate risks:

- Poor productivity (Possible to improbable): task tracking procedure
- Lack of ownership (Improbable to impossible): signed the IP agreement
- Low stakeholder engagement (Probable to improbable): active communication, set agendas before meetings so everyone can be more prepared, lucky to have nice stakeholders
- Inadequate risk assessment (Probable to improbable): research and open for advice
- The ANU tech support can’t be reached: drop-in, via email, via clients, in progress
- Inaccurate estimation of the timeframe (Probable to Possible): from communication to get to know the details of the project more
- The product doesn’t meet stakeholders' expectations (Probable to Possible): agile methodology, integrating the prototype, and discuss with the clients many times.
- Poor documentation (Probable to Possible): create team charter, work records, product requirements, statement of work, risk assessment, retrospectives…
- Sudden growth in requirements (Intolerable and Probable to Tolerable and Possible): using agile methodology, integrating the prototype, frequent and active communication with clients, be very clear about the harm of change requirements frequently.
- Team member turnover: maintaining a harmonious communication environment

## Technical Risks

### Severity

### Future approaches to mitigate risks:

- The website is not compatible with the ANU server:<br> Communicate with the ANU IT department early before deployment.

- Retrived order request form information do not match with attributes:<br> Properly name all the fields in the form to avoid loss of information or confusion.

- Uploaded attachments do not match with correct customer when submitting the form simultaneously:<br> Assign each customer a unique identifier when they upload the files.
